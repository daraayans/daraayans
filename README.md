<h5>Digital Craftsman (Developer/Photographer/Creator)</h5>

<p>I'm a Nigerian Front-End Developer Major, Photographer and a visual creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. ALl coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All Pictures are built in the same way, from ideation and planning to tell a story, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish my photography content on Instagram "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/papishelbystudios?igsh=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr" style="text-decoration: none";>PapiShelbyStudios</a>". </p>
